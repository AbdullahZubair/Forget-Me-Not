## Tame Your Unsupported Module Warnings with ForgetMeNot:

Are you fed up with those annoying "unsupported module" error messages ruining your Drupal experience? It’s like being told your favorite band is “no longer together” just because they haven’t released a new album—*thanks for the reminder, Drupal!*

If you’re using modules maintained by [**D7Security (Extended Support for Drupal 7)**](https://www.d7security.org), you might be scratching your head while these warnings pop up. Why should a little thing like “unsupported” stop you from using quality modules that still bring value to your site?
